## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## About the game

This is a memory matching game, made by manipulating the DOM using javascript. It works by clicking on a card to reveal what is underneath, check a second card for match, if it matches it stays opened, if not, it closes. Do this with least moves to get a better rating. At the end of the game a modal is displayed showing the time, the number of moves made and the rating. Some external libraries were used such as bootstrap and google fonts as it depended on them.
